        <h3>Here’s a timeline of Nikola Tesla’s life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1856</strong> - Born in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (now
            Croatia)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1875</strong> - Enrolls at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz,
            where he studies electrical engineering and becomes fascinated with
            electricity and physics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1881</strong> - Moves to Budapest and works for the Central
            Telegraph Office. While walking in a park, he conceives of the
            rotating magnetic field, the foundational concept for his invention
            of the AC motor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1882</strong> - Moves to Paris to work for the Continental
            Edison Company, repairing direct current (DC) power plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1884</strong> - Emigrates to the United States and begins
            working for Thomas Edison in New York. Despite their initial respect
            for each other, they soon clash over their differing electrical
            systems: Tesla favors alternating current (AC), while Edison is
            committed to direct current (DC).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1887</strong> - Secures funding and establishes the Tesla
            Electric Company. Files numerous patents for AC-based electrical
            systems, including the AC motor and transformer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1888</strong> - Demonstrates the practicality of alternating
            current (AC) for long-distance electrical transmission, which
            catches the attention of industrialist George Westinghouse. Tesla
            sells his patents to Westinghouse, and the “War of Currents” against
            Edison’s DC system begins.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1893</strong> - Westinghouse and Tesla's AC system triumphs
            when it’s chosen to power the Chicago World’s Fair, showcasing AC’s
            potential to the world. Tesla also pioneers the development of
            wireless communication and remote control during this time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1895</strong> - Builds the first hydroelectric power plant
            at Niagara Falls, which supplies power to Buffalo, New York,
            demonstrating the vast capabilities of AC electricity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1898</strong> - Unveils a radio-controlled boat at Madison
            Square Garden, a precursor to modern wireless technology and
            robotics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1901</strong> - Begins construction of the Wardenclyffe
            Tower, an ambitious project aimed at transmitting wireless energy
            across the globe. Despite its potential, the project is abandoned
            due to lack of funding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1909</strong> - Tesla experiments with high-voltage,
            high-frequency electricity, leading to the invention of the Tesla
            coil, which is still used today in radio technology and other
            scientific applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1931</strong> - Celebrates his 75th birthday with widespread
            recognition for his work in electrical engineering, though many of
            his later ideas, like wireless power transmission, remain
            unfinished.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1943</strong> - Dies in New York City at the age of 86. The
            U.S. Supreme Court credits Tesla as the inventor of radio,
            recognizing his essential patents over Marconi.
          </li>
        </ul>
